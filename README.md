# Command Line Interface - .NET Core
An application that reads a text file, and echoes the contents of that text file to the console. The output to the console is paced to match reading it aloud. You can speed up or slow down the pace by pressing the ‘&lt;’ or ‘>’ keys.

## How to use it:
Simple [install Dotnet Core V2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linux/rhel) and run the command:

```
dotnet run
```

Inside the project folder.
If some dependecy is missing, you must run:
```
 dotnet restore
```
And **NuGet** will install it for you.
